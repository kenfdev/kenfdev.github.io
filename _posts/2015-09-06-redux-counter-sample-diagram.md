I know I&#8217;m using lots of different libraries recently but it&#8217;s just so hard to find one that really fits my needs. Every library seems awesome but when I look at another library, it looks even more awesome!

So I&#8217;ve tried redux and it definitely is one of those awesome libraries &#8211; but still, a little complicated. I just didn&#8217;t want to forget the flow so I wrote a diagram.
